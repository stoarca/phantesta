# Phantesta

Phantesta is a testing library built on top of phantomjs-node or selenium.
It allows you to
write regression tests to ensure a rendered portion of a page does not change.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev phantesta
```

## Usage

```js
import { syncify } from 'jasmine_test_utils';
import path from 'path';
import phantom from 'phantom';
import Phantesta from 'phantesta';

describe('my test suite', function() {
  var instance = null;
  var page = null;
  var diffPage = null;
  var phantesta = null;

  beforeAll(syncify(async function() {
    instance = await phantom.create(['--web-security=false']);
    diffPage = await instance.createPage();
  }));
  afterAll(syncify(async function() {
    await instance.exit();
  }));
  beforeEach(syncify(async function() {
    phantesta = new Phantesta(diffPage, {
      screenshotPath: path.resolve(__dirname, '../screenshots'),
    });
    page = await instance.createPage();
  }));
  afterEach(syncify(async function() {
    if (page) {
      await instance.execute('phantom', 'invokeMethod', ['clearCookies']);
      await page.close();
      page = null;
    }
  }));

  beforeEach(function() {
    phantesta.group(__dirname);
  });

  afterEach(function() {
    phantesta.ungroup();
  });

  it('should do some tests', syncify(async function() {
    await page.open('http://www.google.com');
    await phantesta.expect(page).toMatchScreenshot('unique_snapshot_name');
    await phantesta.expect(page).toMatchScreenshot('unique_snapshot_name2');
    await phantesta.expectSame('unique_snapshot_name', 'unique_snapshot_name2');
    await page.open('http://www.asdf.com');
    await phantesta.expect(page).toMatchScreenshot('another_website');
    await phantesta.expectDiff('unique_snapshot_name', 'another_website');
  }));
});
```

Snapshots will be stored in the `screenshotPath` directory with (default)
suffixes of `.good.png`, `.new.png`, `.diff.png`. You should commit all the
`.good.png` images to your git repository, and add all the `.new.png` and
`.diff.png` images to your `.gitignore`.

If an image is expected to be stable and it hasn't changed, it will only
have a `.good.png` in the screenshots directory. If it has changed, there will
be a `.new.png` and `.diff.png`, which represent the new screenshot and the
diff between the new screenshot and the old (good) one. If a change is
expected and intentional, overwrite the `.good.png` image with the `.new.png` image.
Because the `.good.png` images are committed to your repository, they will also
show up as changes in your code review tool.

## UI for managing screenshots

Eventually, you will have enough snapshots that it becomes a burden to manually
inspect and move them around. There is a UI that comes with Phantesta that
makes it significantly easier to review and accept changed snapshots. To do so,
run
```bash
    phantesta-server --host localhost --port 7991 --screenshotPath tests/visual/screenshots
```
then visit `localhost:7991` after running tests. This site will have all the
failed snapshots, with the option to view and accept diffs to snapshots.

## API

### new Phantesta(diffPage, options)

 - `diffPage` is one of:
   - a node-phantomjs page which is not used for anything else
   - a selenium driver which is not used for anything else
 - `options` is a dict with the keys
   - `screenshotPath` defaults to `"tests/visual/screenshots"`
   - `goodExt` defaults to `".good.png"`
   - `newExt` defaults to `".new.png"`
   - `diffExt` defaults to `".diff.png"`
   - `expectToBe` defaults to `function(actual, expected) { expect(actual).toBe(expected) }`
   - `expectNotToBe` defaults to `function(actual, expected) { expect(actual).not.toBe(expected) }`

Override the expectToBe and expectNotToBe calls with methods from your test
framework if you're not using jasmine.

### async Phantesta.prototype.expect(page, target) -> ScreenshotExpect

 - `page` is one of:
   - the node-phantomjs page of which a screenshot is to be taken
   - the selenium driver of which a screenshot is to be taken
 - `target` is a selector used to target a portion of the page

Passes if the screenshot is unchanged relative to the good `name` screenshot.
Fails and leaves `.new.png` and `.diff.png` images in the `screenshotPath` if
the screenshot has changed relative to the good `name` screenshot

#### async ScreenshotExpect.prototype.censorMatching(selector) -> ScreenshotExpect
 - `selector` is a CSS selector with which you mean to ignore a part of the screenshot for comparison
 - For example, `phantesta.expect(page).censorMatching('.ignore-in-ui-test').toMatchScreenshot('name');`

#### async ScreenshotExpect.prototype.censorRect(x, y, width, height) -> ScreenshotExpect
 - takes parameters for a box (with 0,0 in the top left), and censors that box so that it is excluded from any comparison
 - that is, the box censored by this method will contain pixels that can contain anything without failing the test

#### async ScreenshotExpect.prototype.includeOnlyRect(x, y, width, height) -> ScreenshotExpect
 - takes parameters for a box (with 0,0 in the top left), and censors anything not in that box from being included in the image comparison
 - if you include only multiple elements, their union is included and all other things are excluded
 - if you don't specify anything to include only, everything is included by default

#### async ScreenshotExpect.prototype.includeOnlyMatching(selector) -> ScreenshotExpect
 - finds all elements in the page matching `selector` and calls `includeOnlyRect` on them.

### async Phantesta.prototype.expectSame(name1, name2, boxes)

Passes if the screenshot `name1` is the same as `name2`. Fails otherwise.

 - `boxes` is an array of objects defining regions to ignore in the comparison where each region is defined with `x`, and `y` of the top left corner, as well as `w`, and `h` for width and height
  - e.g. `{ x: 100, y: 100, w: 100, h: 100 }` for a region positioned at (100, 100) that is 100 pixels in width and height

### async Phantesta.prototype.expectDiff(name1, name2, boxes)

Passes if the screenshot `name1` is different than `name2`. Fails otherwise.

 - `boxes` is an array of objects defining regions to ignore in the comparison where each region is defined with `x`, and `y` of the top left corner, as well as `w`, and `h` for width and height
  - e.g. `{ x: 100, y: 100, w: 100, h: 100 }` for a region positioned at (100, 100) that is 100 pixels in width and height

### Phantesta.prototype.group(groupName)

Change the current screenshot directory to a subdirectory named `groupName`.
Can be called multiple times.

Returns the current screenshot directory

### Phantesta.prototype.group()

Change the current screenshot directory to the parent.
Can be called multiple times.

If the current screenshot directory is the root screenshot directory,
this has no effect.

Returns the current screenshot directory

__NOTE:__ Place the call to `group` and `ungroup` inside
`beforeEach` and `afterEach` respectively when using jasmine.
